    <h1>Numpy </h1>
    <p> There will be two main libraries we will use for understanding our data. The first one we will learn about is Numpy.
    We learned about lists in the introduction to python, but using the built in python lists doesn't come with all
  the nice tools and speed that numpy arrays have. To use numpy you need to first install it using pip if you have not already.
  You should navigate to the terminal and type in </p>
  <pre><code>pip install numpy</code></pre>
    <h2>Understanding array</h2>
    <p>Now that we have numpy download we can use it when coding in python.</p>
    <pre><code>import numpy as np
    a = np.array([2, 3, 4])</code></pre>

  <p> array transforms sequences of sequences into two-dimensional arrays, sequences of sequences of sequences into three-dimensional arrays, and so on</p>
  <p> Try testing out the above code. What is inside a. Also try using other imputs into array. When applying operations to arrays
  it is applied element wise</p>
  <pre><code>import numpy as np
  a = np.array([2, 3, 4])
  b = np.array([1, 5, 6])
  c = a*b;
  </code></pre>
  <p> At the end of this code c will hold the array [2,15,24] which is different than normal matrix multiplication</p>
  <p>some useful properties of arrays: </p>
  <p>- a.shape gives you the size of the array</p>
  <p>- a[:,4] < 5 is a boolean statement which will output an array comparing each number in a to 5 and returning true of false</p>
  <p>- a.ravel() will turn any array into a 1 dimensional array</p>
  <p>- a.ravel() will turn any array into a 1 dimensional array</p>
  <h1>Pandas </h1>
  <p> The second library is pandas similarly to numpy it comes with nice tools and speed. We need to first install it using pip if you have not already.
You should navigate to the terminal and type in </p>
<pre><code>pip install pandas</code></pre>
