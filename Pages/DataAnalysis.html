  <h1>Analysis Time </h1>
  <h2 id="a.-github.">Pandas</h2>
  <p> This Assignment is very open ended. I would like you to come up with 1 questions that can be answered from the data you collected</p>
  <h2>A. Google Colab</h2>
  <p> We will be working off of the colab that you made last time. Remember that every time you close out of colab you need to re run all the boxes to re get that information.
 </p>

  <h2>B. Questions</h2>
  <p> Create a new text box and add the three questions you will try to answer. </p>
  <h2>C. Pandas</h2>
  <p> For projects you will get to choose between numpy and pandas. I personally prefer pandas for data science so that is what we will be teaching. Now we need to add a new import
    statement. <code>import pandas as pd</code>.
    We have introduced lists, but pandas has a similar data structure that is more efficient when it comes to analysis called a data frame. The first thing we are going to do is convert our list into a data frame and appropriately name it.
</p>
  <pre><code>df = pd.DataFrame(list)
  df.columns = ["coulmn name 1","coulmn name 2","coulmn name 3"]</code></pre>
<p> You can now name your columns.</p>
<h2>D. Comparison and CSVs</h2>
<p> We have already compiled a second data set for you that is in a csv. You should come up with a second question that can be answered by comparing the two csvs.</p>
<h2>E. Graphs</h2>
<p> We will talk more about graphs as we get into web design, but think of a useful graph</p>
