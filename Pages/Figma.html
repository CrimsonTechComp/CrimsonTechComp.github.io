    <h1> Figma </h1>
    <p> Now that we understand all these elements of design. It's time to think about drawing them out. The main tool we use is called Figma. </p>

<h2>Figma Layout</h2>
<p> Our friends at design made this helpful graphic to understand what the different tools in figma are.</p>
<center>
<img src="/Pic/Fig.png" alt="Figma Overview"/>
</center>
<h2>Crimson</h2>
<p>The crimson has already an established set of colors and fonts that we use. </p>
<center>
<img src="/Pic/Crimson.png" alt="Crimson Font+Colors" width="800" height="400" >
</center>

<p> You can use this as a reference when designing and selecting font's, colors, sizes.</p>
<p><b>Fonts Ninja</b> is a useful extension to find out what the values are of any color you see on chrome to later replicate. </p>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<p>You have to remeber to think about what the design looks like when the navbar is clicked. We also want to consider the crimson on mobile and how that affects UI and UX.</p>
