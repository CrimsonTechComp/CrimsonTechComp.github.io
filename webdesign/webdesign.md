Design Principles
=================

It's important for our websites to be aesthic and functional!

Understanding UI/UX
-------------------

UX stands for user experiance design which means designing how a user should experiance the webpage through understanding the different possibilites for interaction. Formally: User experience design is the process of supporting user behavior through usability, usefulness, and desirability provided in the interaction with a product.

UI stands for user interface design. UI is focused on the aesthic of the product. Such as thinking about typography, color palettes, and size while trying to aid in the UX design. Formally: User interface design or user interface engineering is the design of user interfaces for machines and software, such as computers, home appliances, mobile devices, and other electronic devices, with the focus on maximizing usability and the user experience. Now we are going to go over some things to think about when designing UI and UX.

Typography
----------

Tone and Type -- related to font choices and how they interact with the eyes of the viewer. A more indepth guide to typography can be found in this [Medium](https://medium.com/gravitdesigner/typography-elements-everyone-needs-to-understand-5fdea82f470d) page.

Tone
----

Tone refers to the product's personality. Is it formal, funny, respectful or enthusathic and how do you make your design's match the tone of the website or product.

What tone do these images give you? What is similar between them and what attracts your eye? We want everyone to look at the crimson landing page and know that it is a newspaper, but we don't want the same tone on the flyby website.

Articulating Tone: FONT!!!!
---------------------------

Once we know what tone we want we can think about how to incoprate this into our design. From color, form, spacing, and preconceived notions of how we look at fonts!

Different font's protray different meanings. The best example is comic sans which is regarded as a meme font. It wouldn't be appropiate to put serious knews in comic sans. It is also important to think about how color and size can change or amplify the meaning of words. For example a colorful text in a big font wouldn't be considered buisness' like.

Going back to thinking about UX design. Larger text draws attention guiding people to read the text. Some colors come with pre associated meanings that can help the user experiance the website such as green and red. Combining different fonts also has an art to it because they all need to relate to the central theme and tone.

Hierarchy
--------

One of the main roles of hierarchy is to help keep your ideas organized, so that viewers can always identify which category of information they are reading.

We can see her how important size is. By having the largest thing on the page be the Bakery's name you are more like to remember it and look at it first. It also draws attention to the navbar and the other parts of the website allowing users to more easily navigate. When establishing a heriachy we are going to want to also think about white space on a website and how that can draw the user in. A crowded website is hard to look at it.
