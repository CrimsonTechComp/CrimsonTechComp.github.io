Introduction to Python
======================

This page will serve more as informational and a resource for compers and members to find useful review and information on how to code in python. Python comes automatically with your computer so its easy to get started. There are a few different IDE's that we recommed, but you can check out that page seperately.

The Basics: Strings, Printing and Variables
-------------------------------------------

Printing in python is pretty easy:

    print("Hello World");

So now lets say that you have a variable. Each variable has a type that python automatically knows when you give it a value. The most common types are

|  Type |    Examples   |               Explanation              | p_ask, t |
|:-----:|:-------------:|:--------------------------------------:|----------|
|  Bool | True or False |                 Boolean                | 6        |
| Float |      3.4      | real numbers that have a decimal point | 8.51     |
|  int  |       1       |                intergers               | 11.2     |
|  str  |    "Mexico"   |                 strings                | 22.5     |
|  list |   [1,2,"hi"]  |              list objects              | 27.21    |
| tuple |     (1,2)     |              just 2 vlaues             | 29.99    |

Python can preform many different types of operations for us on ints and floats. Such as

|                  Type                  | Symbol |
|:--------------------------------------:|:------:|
|                   Add                  |    +   |
|                Subtract                |    -   |
|                Multiply                |    *   |
|                Exponent                |   **   |
|        divide and get a decimal        |    /   |
| divide and get a rounded down interger |   //   |
|                 Modulo                 |    %   |

Loops and Conditionals
----------------------

### If Statements

If you want to execute certain commands of code with conditionals than If Statements are your friend

    x = 1
    y = 2
    if x < y:
      print("hi")
    elif x > y:
      print("yooo")
    else:
      print("we equal dude")
    

Important to remember is that indentation tells python what should be executed if the condition is observered.

### While Loops

While loops allow you to execute the same piece of code over and over until one condition is met

    answer = false
    while not answer:
        print("answer meeeee")
    

This piece of code will run forever because the variable in the condition never changes and can't become false.

### For Loops

for loops allow you to execute the same piece of code a set amount of times

    for i in range(7):
        print(i);
    
This code will print the numbers 1 through 7. After the word in for loops can take any type of list which will be useful in data analysis.

### Files

Most of the time the data that we get will either be in a csv or webscraped. If you want to work with a csv you have to import it. Most of the time we will be working with something called a dataframe from pandas. Pro Tip: Make sure that the csv is in the same folder as the file you are coding in for easiest acess

    with open("file_name") as f:   
        s = f.read()

    import pandas as pd
    df = pd.read_csv ('file_name.csv')
    print(df)

### Try Except

Some times your code will throw an error, but you know what you want to happen when that error occurs. In try except you can try a piece of code and then instead of exiting when an error is thrown. The program will catch a certain error and then you can choose what to do. This is a very similar to an if else conditional.

    try:
        results[0].text.strip()
    except Attribute Error:
        #what should it do if you get this error. Maybe figure out what is causing this error.
