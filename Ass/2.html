      <h1>Python Programming</h1>
      <p>
        You are welcome to work with other compers but everyone should submit
        there own code! This assignment will be on the github page. Remeber to
        use google and the python page if you get stuck for refrence!
      </p>
      <h2>A. Terminal</h2>
      <p>
        Open up your terminal. We are going to navigate to your forked crimtech
        repository. Through the terminal using
        <code> cd crimtech-comp-s22 </code>. Now you should be inside your
        repository. Now type in <code> git pull upstream master </code>. Now
        your repository should be up to date. It can be tricky working with the
        terminal and git so make sure to ask NK or KL if you get an error
        message. If you have a merge conflict make sure to edit the file where
        the conflict occcurs and git commit before trying to pull again.
      </p>
      <h2>B. IDE</h2>
      <p>
        Now we are going to write code. There are many different platforms to
        write code in. The most popular of which are Visual Studio Code.
      </p>
      <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/free-developer-offers/">
        You can download Visual Studio Code here.</a
      >
      <i
        >NK uses atom!!! which is just a text editor so you have to run your
        code in the terminal.
      </i>
      <p>
        Make sure the version you download works with your computer. Getting an
        IDE is the hardest thing for new programmers! So don't get overwhelemd
        it gets way easier from here. After you download an IDE open up the
        python folder in the crimtech repo(repository)
      </p>
      <h2>C. Square Root</h2>
      <p>
        Write a function that returns the square root of a given variable n. If
        n is negative or not a number, returns -1. Put your code in
        square_root.py
      </p>
      <h2>D. Random Ints</h2>
      <p>
        Write a program that randomly generates numbers in the range [1,10] and
        appends them to a list, until it generates a 6, at which point it
        appends that to the list and returns. Put your code in random_ints.py.
      </p>
      <i>HINT: Look into the <code>random</code> library</i> <br>
      <i>HINT: what does (int) (random.random()*10) generate?</i>
      <h2>E. Remove Smallest</h2>
      <p>
        Write a function that given a dictonary removes the key corresponding to
        the minimum value and returns changed dictonary. If the dictionary is
        empty, return the original dictionary. For example input:
      </p>
      <i>HINT: Use Set</i>
      <pre> <code> sampleDict = {
  'Physics': 82,
  'Math': 65,
  'history': 75
}
</code> </pre>
      <p>Output:</p>
      <pre> <code> sampleDict = {
  'Physics': 82,
  'history': 75
}
</code> </pre>

      <h2>E. rm_smallest</h2>
      <p>
        Write a function that given a dictonary removes the key corresponding to
        the minimum value and returns changed dictonary. If the dictionary is
        empty, return the original dictionary. For example input:
      </p>
      <pre> <code> sampleDict = {
  'Physics': 82,
  'Math': 65,
  'history': 75
}
</code> </pre>
      <p>Output:</p>
      <pre> <code> sampleDict = {
  'Physics': 82,
  'history': 75
}
</code> </pre>

      <h2>F. Optional</h2>
      <p>
        Define a class to represent companies. Companies will have a name (given
        at creation), a list of all sales for the year (string of a product),
        and a dictionary of products (strings, keys) and their prices (float
        like, values), as well as a list of employees. Define a function to add
        a new product. The function will take the name of the product and the
        price. Define a function to add an employee, given an employee. Define
        an employee class. Employees will have a name as a string, and a
        company, both given at creation. They will also have a role given at
        creation. A role is represented by a number, with 1 being a new hire,
        and 10 the ceo. Make the role value optional, with the default set to 1.
      </p>
      <h2>G. Push</h2>
      <p>
        When you are done make sure to puch to github. The instructions are the
        same from the first assigment steps G-I.
